To run the project, you need to follow first the instructions in the README file from the backend directory.

Then, in this frontend directory, you need to run 2 commands:

1. ### `npm installs`

This command installs all the packages and dependencies that are needed

2. ### `npm run start`

This commands run the script to start the React App (a navigation tab will automatically open in your browser)
